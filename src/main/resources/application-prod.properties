# --- Production Best Practices ---

# 1. Safer Schema Management
# Use 'validate' in production after the first successful deployment.
# This prevents Hibernate from making accidental, destructive changes to your data.
# For the very first deployment, you can set this to 'update' to create the tables.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate

# 2. Logging
# Ensure SQL queries are not printed to the production logs for performance and security.
spring.jpa.show-sql=false

# 3. Connection Pool Tuning (HikariCP)
# Sets the maximum number of connections the pool can hold.
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
# The maximum time (in ms) a client will wait for a connection from the pool.
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
